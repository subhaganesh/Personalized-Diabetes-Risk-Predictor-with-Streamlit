# Deploying diabetes app in streamlit
A Streamlit app for diabetes prediction is a web-based application built using Streamlit, an open-source Python library.
The app allows users to input various health parameters related to diabetes risk factors, such as the number of pregnancies, glucose level, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin level, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, and age. 
Based on these inputs, the app utilizes a pre-trained machine learning model (previously trained on relevant data) to predict whether the person is likely to have diabetes or not.

The app provides a user-friendly interface where individuals can easily enter their health information and receive an instant prediction.
Streamlit simplifies the process of creating interactive web applications from Python scripts, making it an ideal choice for developing data apps and prototypes.
With Streamlit, data scientists and developers can quickly create web interfaces to showcase data visualizations, models, and other insights, empowering users with the ability to interactively explore data and make informed decisions.
